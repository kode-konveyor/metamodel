   <documentation>* The annotations disabling code checks should be rare and explained
* Exceptions of rules should always be thought out, explained and be available later.
* The right place to explain is right in the annotation (or near it if there is no other way: this is an exception of the "No comments" rule).
* If there are many exceptions, then either you do something wrong, or the rules should be changed: raise the issue so we can solve it
