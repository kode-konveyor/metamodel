   <documentation>Tests should be readable
* adhere to clean code rules here as well
* separate setup, exercise, verify, and teardown optically
* do as much as you can do in setup and teardown methods, optimally leaving out those steps from the tests themselves
* complicated things should be organised out into test helper classes
*  in end-to-end testing, think in processes and steps
