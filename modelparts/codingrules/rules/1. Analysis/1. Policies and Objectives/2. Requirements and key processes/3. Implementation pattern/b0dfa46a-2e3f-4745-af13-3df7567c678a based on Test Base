   <documentation>* Unit test of a Service/Controller must be children of the Test Base unit orresponding to the tested Service/Controller.
* In case of legacy objects a Test Base unit may be created, based on the decision of the coder.
* If a Test Base object is created, it should be used by all the corresponding unit tests.
* The setUp method of unit tests (if exist) must call the setUp method of the superclass as its first instruction.
* unit tests can reference the tested code unit, as it is brought into the namespace by the Test base
