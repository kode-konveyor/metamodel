   <documentation>Ancillary units are put to the same package as the unit they support.

* If the design or needs of testing mandates it, a DTO may have a Factory
* an Entity must have a Repository
* all DTO, Entity, Service and Controller units must have a Test Data
* all Service and Controller units must have a Test Base
* all Service and Controller units must have a Stub Provider
* a legacy object may have a Factory and/or a Stub Provider and/or a Test Data. Those should be put in a package named 'legacy' under the main package of the project.
