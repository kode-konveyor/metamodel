   <documentation>Test code, test artifacts, stubs and test helper methods should be strictly separated.

* The Test units must contain only test functions, and possibly setUp and tearDown methods with setup and teardown of locally used mechanisms.
* Stub Providers must contain only stubs describing behaviour of production code or external dependencies
* Test Data units must contain only Test Artifacts, including mocks describing behaviour of parameters
* Test Helpers must contain only helper functions supporting the test cases
* Test Bases must contain only constructs building the unit under test, injecting the mocks of its dependencies, and calls to behaviour stubs of the dependencies
